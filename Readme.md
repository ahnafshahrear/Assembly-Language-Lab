3rd Year 2nd Semester - Microprocessor & Assembly Language Lab

# Title: Case Conversion and String Reversal Problems
# 1(a) Case Conversion
- Write an assembly language program to implement a case conversion program that will read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input and then convert the letters into its opposite case as output. Here, the characters which are not belonged to letters will remain be unchanged. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
# 1(b) String Reversal
- Write an assembly language program to implement a string reversal program that will read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input and then make the reverse form of the string as output. You have to solve this problem in two ways such as (i) using array (ii) using stack. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
