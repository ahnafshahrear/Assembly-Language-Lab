## Title: Case Conversion and String Reversal Problems

### 1(a) Case Conversion ✓

- Write an assembly language program to implement a case conversion program that will read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input and then convert the letters into its opposite case as output. Here, the characters which are not belonged to letters will remain be unchanged. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

### 1(b) String Reversal ✓
- Write an assembly language program to implement a string reversal program that will read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input and then make the reverse form of the string as output. You have to solve this problem in two ways such as (i) using array (ii) using stack. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

## Title: String Searching Problems

### 2(a) Find Capital Letter ✓
- Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read a string (a line of letters of English alphabet) as input and then find out the first capital letter which is occurred first and last capital letter which is occurred last in the alphabetical order as output. Your program will display a message with "No Capitals" when there is no capital letter in the string. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

### 2(b) Longest Alphabetical Sequence
- Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read a string (a word of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercase or all in lowercase but not both) as input and then find out the longest sequence of letters in the word in alphabetical order. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

### 2(c) Check Substring ✓
- Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read two strings (two words of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercases or all in lowercases but not both) as input and then determine whether a string is a substring of another string or not. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

## Title: Counting and Sorting Problems

### 3(a) Count Vowels, Consonants, Digits & Spaces
- Write an assembly language program to implement a counting program that will read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input and then count the number of Vowels, Consonants, Digits, and Spaces in the string as output. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

### 3(b) Sorting String
- Write an assembly language program to implement a sorting program that will read a string (a word of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercase or all in lowercase but not both) as input and then sort the letters in the word in alphabetically (i) ascending order (ii) descending order. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
